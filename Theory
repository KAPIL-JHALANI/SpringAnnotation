Here we use the config class instead of using xml
@congiguration -> congig class
@component scan -> scan all the components inside the given package

// here we provide the bean id  in @component annotation but by default the bean id for @component annoation is
// same as the class name with first letter is in lowercase for this Class i we do not want to give the manual name to bean then default id is "college"
//@Component("collegebean")
public class College {

    public void test(){
        System.out.println("all good");
    }
}



//by default bean id is same as the method name.
    //we also provider the list of bean id if we want to give several name to a single bean eg: @Bean(name={"collgebeanhai","co1","co2"})
    @Bean(name="collgebeanhai")
    public College collegehai(){
        College college=new College();
        return college;
    }



@component
@primary

@primary used if we have various beans for one interface and wanrt to prioritise one then we used this @primary annotation
